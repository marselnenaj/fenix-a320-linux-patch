# Fenix A320 Linux Patch

Compatibility fixes and an installer for **Fenix A320 with MSFS 2024 in
[Flightdeck](https://github.com/marselnenaj/flightdeck-msfs-2024-linux-xbox)** and,
as an untested first version, for the **Steam editions of MSFS 2020 and 2024**.
Community preview; independent of Fenix Simulations, Microsoft and Asobo.

This packages the Wine fixes tested with Fenix **2.4.0.4720**, MSFS 2024
**1.8.16.0** and Xodus Wine **11.0 / 7c0b4354**. PFD, ND, ECAM, MCDU, clock,
FCU and radio display rendering were checked in a running cockpit. A complete
flight and other Fenix versions have not been independently validated.

**Preview.5** adds the standalone Steam installation with a guided setup and an
overlay for CachyOS Proton 11.0 (20261005), next to the overlays for Proton
Experimental 11.0 (20260924) and CachyOS Proton 10.0 sunset. Their loader, memory,
audio, cursor, helper-window and Direct2D regression probes pass; a complete
Fenix/MSFS flight on these runners has not been validated. Route geometry and automatic MCDU display refresh remain
available. See
[display restart handling](docs/mcdu-restart.md).

## Install on Steam

1. Start MSFS 2020 or 2024 once in Steam, then close it.
2. Download and extract the **Linux installer ZIP** from
   [Releases](https://github.com/marselnenaj/fenix-a320-linux-patch/releases)
   and run `./install.sh` (or double-click *Fenix A320 Linux Patch*). A guided
   setup opens in your browser; it runs only on your computer. No `sudo` is needed.
3. Follow its five steps. Each shows what it does and one button: install the
   patch, let Steam use **Proton Fenix A320**, run the official Fenix Installer,
   sign in, apply the display settings. Finished steps are ticked, so you can
   close the setup and continue later.

The installer creates the separate Proton because Steam keeps updating Proton
Experimental; your other Proton versions and games are not changed. With Steam
closed it selects that Proton for the simulator itself; otherwise force it under
*Properties → Compatibility*. `./install.sh --text` runs the same steps in a terminal.

The Steam path has not been run with a real Steam simulator yet, and MSFS 2020
with Fenix is untested. See [Steam details and limits](docs/steam.md).

## Install in Flightdeck

1. Install and run MSFS 2024 once using Flightdeck. Close the simulator and Fenix.
2. Download and extract the **Linux installer ZIP** from
   [Releases](https://github.com/marselnenaj/fenix-a320-linux-patch/releases).
3. Run `./install.sh` inside the extracted folder and choose the Flightdeck
   simulator in the guided setup, then **Install patch**. No `sudo` is needed.
4. Download the official Fenix Installer from your
   [Fenix account](https://fenixsim.com/dashboard/). Choose **Run Fenix
   Installer**, complete its prerequisites and aircraft installation, then close it.
5. Choose **Open Fenix**. Sign in and activate your purchased aircraft normally,
   then close Fenix and its helpers.
6. Choose **Apply settings** (CPU displays + Legacy readouts). Launch MSFS through Flightdeck.

Flightdeck's **Add-ons → Fenix A320** panel provides the same workflow without
opening a terminal. It downloads a pinned, checksummed patch release. Login and
activation remain in the official Fenix software.

Requirements: x86_64 Linux, Python 3.10+, glibc **2.38+**, GNU `cp`, and the
one of the exact Xodus/Proton builds pinned in `bundle.json`. The guided setup uses your
web browser and needs no additional packages. The Microsoft Framework and geometry
downloads need internet access. The official Fenix Installer handles its
WebView2, .NET Desktop Runtime and Visual C++ prerequisites.

Flightdeck can switch a patched installation between supported runners while
retaining aircraft, add-ons and settings. Each overlay is compiled from that
runner’s Wine revision; its DXVK/VKD3D stay unchanged. Other Proton builds require
a matching overlay before Fenix can use them. In Flightdeck, MSFS 2020 remains
outside this preview. Flightdeck can migrate recognized local Fenix setups when
switching Proton; arbitrary modified launch scripts are preserved and rejected.

## Command line

Without `--runtime` or `--steam`, the installer uses the only simulator it
finds. `--steam msfs2020|msfs2024` takes the same commands as `--runtime`.

```sh
./install.sh targets
./install.sh install --steam msfs2024
./install.sh select --steam msfs2024      # with Steam closed
./install.sh status --runtime /path/to/flightdeck/runtime
./install.sh install --runtime /path/to/flightdeck/runtime
./install.sh installer --runtime /path/to/flightdeck/runtime --exe "$HOME/Downloads/FenixInstaller.exe"
./install.sh open --runtime /path/to/flightdeck/runtime
./install.sh configure --runtime /path/to/flightdeck/runtime
./install.sh restore --runtime /path/to/flightdeck/runtime
```

`install` creates an independent runner and Windows profile, installs native
Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8 when needed, prepares a checksum-verified Direct2D
geometry dependency, copies the existing runner's fonts and graphics dependencies,
and installs the compatibility overlay after the staging Wine session exits. It retains the
original runner, profile and launch scripts. An interrupted installation has a
recovery journal. Repeating an already completed installation verifies its files.
Running `install` from preview.5 also updates verified preview.1–preview.4 installations,
retaining installed aircraft, settings and the original restore point. Flightdeck
performs that update before opening Fenix applications when needed.

`restore` restores the profile from before the patch and retains the newer
profile in a separate local directory. Settings or add-ons installed since the
patch remain in that retained profile; Community content outside the profile is
not removed. Flightdeck's separate Xbox save storage is not part of this restore.

## Displays and windows

The current working configuration uses **CPU** rendering and **Legacy** FCU
readouts. Weather radar is unavailable with this rendering path. Brightness
knobs remain normal aircraft controls; the installer does not force lighting
values or autopilot modes. A bounded display-refresh helper temporarily changes
the pop-out display preference after Fenix Display starts, then restores it.
Near maximum brightness it also performs a DIM/BRT round-trip, preserving the
brightness setting. It sends no page or flight-plan keys. FMA text depends on
the active flight modes.

On X11/Xwayland, the patched driver keeps only the matching Fenix service/display
windows off the desktop while preserving their internal visibility and startup
events. The bundled window guard remains a fallback for other drivers. Fenix's
main application, sign-in and installer remain accessible. See
[window handling](docs/hyprland.md) for scope and desktop limitations.

Navigation geometry now respects path metrics, line joins, caps, dashes and
miter limits. This repairs missing routes and the long lines caused by acute
route joins. The geometry provider is enabled only for `FenixDisplay.exe`; Wine
continues to render the displays. See [the rendering checks](docs/stroke-contours.md).

## What is distributed

The release contains our installer and helper tools, Wine patches, eleven Wine
replacement binaries and their complete source archives/build instructions.
**No Fenix or Microsoft binaries, aircraft, fonts, activation data, saved
profiles or private logs are included.** Microsoft redistributables are fetched
from Microsoft and verified against pinned hashes. Existing fonts are read
from your own compatible runner.

Installer/window guard: MIT. Wine patches and derived Wine binaries:
LGPL-2.1-or-later; upstream notices are retained in the included source archives.
See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) and [THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md).

For a bug report, include patch/Fenix/MSFS versions, distribution, desktop and
the failing step. Do not upload your Wine profile, account files, license data
or raw logs without reviewing them first.
